<!--     
    Parent element is called relative
    child element will be always absolute
    Primarily child element remains bottom-0 left-0
    inline হলে পাশে থাকে
    inline-block হলে নিচে চলে যাবে
    block হলে পুরো লাইন জুড়ে থাকবে
    hidden কোন কিছু লুকানোর জন্য

    z-index ব্যবহার:
    ছোট টা নিচে থাকবে আর বড় টা উপরে থাকবে
